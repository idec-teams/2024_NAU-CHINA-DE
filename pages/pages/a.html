At Homestead, Steve befriended Bill Fernandez, a neighbor who shared his interests in electronics. It was Bill who first
introduced him to another computer whiz kid, an older guy named Stephen Wozniak, or — as everybody used to call him —
Woz. Steve and Woz met in 1969, when they were respectively 14 and 19. At the time, Woz was building a little computer
board with Bill Fernandez that they called “the Cream Soda Computer”.</p>
