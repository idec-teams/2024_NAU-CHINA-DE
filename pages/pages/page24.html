<h4 class="Experiment">Experiment:</h4>
<p>
    1.Plasmid extraction for pHCM12M. <br>
    2.PCR to verify if the products contain the plasimd of pHCM12M and extract gel DNA of the correct bands. <br>
    3.POE-PCR to construct recombinant polymers0/2/4/4/6/6 using pHM12M and PETase0/2/4/6 of 8.13 and extract gel DNA. <br>
    4.Colony PCR to verify if the tansformed SCK6 of 8.14 contains the gene of PETase's mutations and sequence. <br>
    5.Prepare plates of LB containing 2% PBAT <br>
    6.Shake the bacteria solution containing pHCM12M.

<h4 class="result">Result: </h4>
<p>
There are non-specificity bands at the agarose gel, one of them matched the expected results.
The bands of recombinant polymers0/2/4/4/6/6 matched the expected results. <br>
