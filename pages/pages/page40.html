<p class="Experiment_content">1.PCR to obtain the vector with homology arm from PETase and gel extraction.<br>
2.Colony PCR to verify if the D2/10/11 contains the gene of PETase's mutations and sequence.<br>
3.POE-PCR to construct recombinant polymers using pHM12M and PETase and extract gel DNA.<br>
4.Colony PCR with the primers of isPETsae-testR/F and 8YC R/F to verify if the ND1 contains the gene of PETase's mutation and sequence.<br>
5.Colony PCR with the primers of IsPETsae-testR/F and 8YC R/F to verify if the wt IsPETase contains the gene of PETase's and sequence.<br>
6.Inoculate 1% of the KT2440 and KT2440-tph inoculum mother liquor into 20 ml of inorganic salt medium containing 300 ppm of 1,4-butanediol/TPA (prepared by adding 600 μl of 10000 ppm mother liquor). Culture at 30℃ and 180 rpm, and measure the Abs600 every 12 hours. <br></p>
